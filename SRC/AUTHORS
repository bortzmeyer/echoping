With help from:

W. Richard Stevens, author of the book "Unix network programming"
for his book and his many examples (a lot of the code comes from
him by copy-and-paste).

Pierre Beyssac <pb@fasterix.freenix.org> author of the "bing" tool for
examples of code and beta-testing.

Christian Grimm <grimm@rvs.uni-hannover.de> for the ICP code.

Samuel Tardieu <sam@inf.enst.fr> for the SMTP code.

Pierre-Yves Lochou <lochou@ilog.fr> for a lot of testing, debugging
and porting.

Glen Turner <glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au> for the Type Of Service code.

The Pasteur Institute because the work was done when working on the
French national Web cache project, while being an employee of the
Institute.
