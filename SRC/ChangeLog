6.1 (NOT YET)

	DO NOT FORGET maintenance branch
	
6.0.1 (2007-04-04)

	* Bug fixes only
	
6.0.0 (2007-03-26)

	* Plugins: several plugins (whois, postgresql, dns) are now
	shipped with echoping and you can write your own. All new
	protocols will now be supported via plugins. Consequences:
	   * you now need an Unix with a working dlopen(3)
	   * echoping now requires the popt parsing library
	* popt: echoping now depends on popt. One main change: options
	parsing is lightly different so some scripts *may* break. A
	typical example is that "old-school" Unix aggreation of arguments
	("echoping -v4 localhost") is no longer accepted (use "echoping -v
	-4 localhost").
        * Many bug fixes, see the list at Sourceforge
	
5.2.0 (2004-02-29)

	* IDN (Unicode domain names) support
	
5.1.0 (2003-11-09)

	* GNU TLS support (alternative to OpenSSL),
	* Small licence change,
	* Portability fixes (MacOS X)
	
5.0.1 (2002-11-04)

	* Small bug fixes,
	* Better error messages with invalid options

5.0.0 (2002-10-11)

	* Now uses getnameinfo/getaddrinfo. Two consequences:
	   - you can compile only on a recent Unix
	   - you have IPv6 support
        * With -v, now able to separate kernel (TCP) and application latency
	* Now displays the standard deviation for repeated tests. Warning:
	  this may break some scripts which parse the output of echoping.
	
4.2.0 (2001-03-16)
	
        * New -a and -A options to control the proxy/cache (disable caching).
	  Fixes bug/wish #232324
	* Support for microsecond wait (uses usleep)
	* New option (-p) to set socket priority (Linux only)

4.1.0 (2001-02-14)

	* Fix several SSL bugs (#132001, #130151)
	* Now requires an ANSI C compiler
	* Now uses only stdarg.h so should really compile everywhere

4.0.2 (2001-01-26)

	* Stupid bug introduced in 4.0.1 when compiling without SSL

4.0.1 (2001-01-26)
